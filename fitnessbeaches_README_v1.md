# FITNESSBEACHES.COM — README (v1)
**Train where the water meets the body.**  
**The sea is your gym.**

FitnessBeaches is not a beach inspiration site.

It is a **movement-first global training map** — a system for finding beaches where you can **run, swim, train, recover, and build your body** using the natural world.

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, structure, templates, and rules** for building the FitnessBeaches mega-site.

---

## 0) The Core Truth (The Reframe)

### Beaches are outdoor gyms.

Most beach websites are passive.  
FitnessBeaches is active.

Beaches are:

- running tracks  
- swim lanes  
- resistance gyms (sand)  
- cold plunge zones  
- breathwork spaces  
- mobility labs  
- endurance arenas  
- recovery environments  

FitnessBeaches exists to say:

> **“This is not just a beautiful beach — this is a place you can train.”**

---

## 1) What FitnessBeaches Is (and Is Not)

### FitnessBeaches IS:
- a global directory of **training-capable beaches**
- a **FitnessScore™ rating system**
- a **fitness-type discovery engine**
- a **climate + conditions intelligence layer**
- a **train-on-arrival tool** (workouts included)
- a high-trust authority with a calm athletic voice

### FitnessBeaches is NOT:
- a blog  
- a “best beaches” list factory  
- a CrossFit bro site  
- a luxury wellness brand  
- a yoga influencer portal  
- a generic travel magazine  

If a page reads like a resort guide, it’s wrong.

---

## 2) The Site’s 3 Primary Pillars

Everything must support one of these pillars:

### A) Individual Beach Pages (the core unit)
Each beach has a canonical training profile and FitnessScore™.

### B) Fitness-Type Browsing (how people actually choose)
People choose how they want to train first, then where to go.

### C) Train + Recover Intelligence
The site must help users plan:
- best training times  
- safety and conditions  
- recovery options nearby  

---

## 3) FitnessScore™ (The Signature IP)

### FitnessScore™ is the core product.
Every beach gets a score from **1–100**.

This score is not a vibe.  
It is a structured evaluation of training quality.

### FitnessScore™ factors (canonical list)
Every beach must be evaluated on:

- **Swim Quality**
- **Runability** (sand firmness, length, continuity)
- **Calisthenics Infrastructure** (bars, walls, rocks, stairs)
- **Water Temperature** (cold plunge / warm swim)
- **Wave Resistance** *(optional training, not required)*
- **Crowding**
- **Sunrise/Sunset Usability**
- **Safety** (crime, currents, hazards, traffic)
- **Climate Consistency** (wind, humidity, seasonal reliability)

### FitnessScore™ philosophy
- A beach can be famous but useless for training.
- A beach can be ugly but elite for performance.
- A “fitness beach” must support movement without constant interruption.
- Recovery counts as training.
- Safety can override everything.

---

## 4) Fitness Types (The Primary Discovery Layer)

Fitness types are first-class objects on the site.

**Canonical Fitness Types:**

- Swim + Run Beach  
- Cold Plunge Beach  
- Sand Training Beach  
- Triathlon-Style Beach  
- Yoga & Mobility Beach  
- Breathwork + Calm-Water Beach  
- High-Resistance Surf Beach  
- Endurance Beach  
- Recovery Beach  

### Rule
Every beach page must be tagged with:
- **at least 1** fitness type  
- **no more than 3** fitness types  

The goal is clarity, not keyword stuffing.

---

## 5) Mega-Site Architecture (Non-Negotiable)

FitnessBeaches scales through structured hubs + canonical beach pages.

### A) Country Hubs

### B) City / Region Hubs (“Fitness Cities”)

### Rule

---

Preferred voice:
> “We train. We respect nature. Here’s the real setup.”

---

- a calm field guide

Visual rules:
- white backgrounds

---

## 16) The One Rule That Protects Everything

**FitnessBeaches only wins if it stays honest.**

If a beach is beautiful but unusable for training, the site must say so.

Honesty is the brand.  
Honesty is the moat.  
Honesty is why it becomes the global authority.
